# Helicopter Status Display Project

## Introduction
In most sensitive and complex devices, especially vehicles, there is a status page that displays comprehensive information from sensors or subsystems in a user-friendly manner. This project aims to design a user-friendly interface using QML to display the status of a helicopter.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and functional status display page for a helicopter using QML.

## Functional Requirements
The designed page includes the following elements:

1. **Fuel**: Display fuel level between 0 to 80.
2. **Battery**: Show battery charge percentage.
3. **Indoor Air Temperature**: Display temperature inside the cabin, ranging from -20 to 80.
4. **Outside Air Temperature**: Display temperature outside, ranging from -20 to 80.
5. **Camera Fixed System Status**: Indicate the status of the camera system with three states: error, warning, and good.
6. **Speed**: Show the speed of the helicopter, ranging from 0 to 220.
7. **Lamps**: Indicate whether the lights are on or off.
8. **Main Rotor Speed**: Display the speed of the main rotor with five states: slowest, slow, medium, fast, and fastest.
9. **Control Panel**: Indicate the status of the control panel with two states: fail and pass.
10. **Radio**: Show the strength of radio waves with three states: strong, good, and weak.

## User Testing

You can contorl the panel using the following keyboard shortcuts :
- Press `Ctrl + Q` to quit
- Press `L` to change lights state
- Press `C` to change camera state
- Press `R` to change radio signals state
- Press `P` to change control panel state
- Press `shift` to increase speed
- Press `right key` to increase inside temperature
- Press `left key` to decrease inside temperature
- Press `key 6` to increase outside temperature
- Press `key 4` to decrease outside temperature
- Press `PgUp key` to increase battery charge
- Press `PgDn key` to decrease battery charge
- Press `key 8` to increase the amount of fuel
- Press `key 2` to decrease the amount of fuel
